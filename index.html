    <h2><span style="color: brown;"><em>About me</em></span></h2>
      <h3>My background</h3>
        <p>My education stopped after highschool, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do 
          and choosing a career at 18 is a very big decision that I wasn't ready to 
          make. I started working in kitchens when I was 16 until present. I worked 
          hard and have never gotten fired from a job, and always was able to take 
          on more responsibility after becoming more knowledgable and comfortable
          in whatever kitchen I was working in. I decided to enroll in Epicodus 
          with the intention to graduate and get a career in tech. I wanted to 
          pursue this because I knew that working in kitchens is not something 
          that I want to do. After this first week at Epicodus I have genuinly found
          enjoyment coding. Which is a little suprising to me, I didn't think I 
          would have as much fun as I am, a very pleasant surprise that was.
        </p>
      <h3>My interests, Hobbies, and Skills</h3>
        <p>Outside of school my interests and hobbies include the following: skating, rock climbing, 
          making music with my friends, and actively trying to better myself as a person to be more 
          healthy physically and mentally.
        </p>
        <p>The skills I have are pretty limited, but I do know how to put my head down and 
          work hard when I need to, I'm am a creative person and can think outside of the box, 
          and I have the ability to make myself and other people food that tastes pretty good too.
